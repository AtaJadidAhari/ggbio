tutorials and case studies.

# NOTICE: 

To avoid confusing and conflicts for developers, we stopped development in github, and move
our development to bioconductor svn repos. 

You *CAN* still report issues here. And this github version control is generally
used for wiki and gh-pages(homepage).

# INSTALL
